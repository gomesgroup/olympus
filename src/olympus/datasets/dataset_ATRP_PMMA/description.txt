Green Photo-ATRP polymerization optimization dataset for 
sustainable PMMA synthesis with minimal copper usage. 
This dataset focuses on achieving excellent polymerization 
performance (high conversion, controlled dispersity, good 
initiation efficiency) while minimizing copper catalyst 
concentration to 1 ppm for environmentally friendly synthesis.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: Minimize Cu concentration (target: 1 ppm)
SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: Maximize conversion, optimize dispersity & efficiency

The dataset contains experimental data for atom transfer 
radical polymerization (ATRP) of methyl methacrylate (MMA) 
using photocatalyst systems optimized for low-copper conditions.
