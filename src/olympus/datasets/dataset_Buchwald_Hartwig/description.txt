Palladium-catalyzed Buchwald-Hartwig reactions. 

Reaction Setup:

Solutions were prepared in DMSO: catalyst (0.05 M), aryl halide (0.5 M), toluidine (0.5 M), additive (0.5 M), and base (0.75 M).
These solutions were added to a 384-well source plate (80 μL per well). The Mosquito HTS liquid handling robot was used to dose each
of these solutions (200 nL each) into a 1536-well plate. The plate was sealed and heated to 60 °C for 16 hours. The plate was then
opened and the Mosquito was used to add internal standard to each well (3 μL of 0.0025 M di-tert-butylbiphenyl solution in DMSO).
At that point, aliquots were sampled into 384-well plates and analyzed by UPLC which was used to quantify product yield.
