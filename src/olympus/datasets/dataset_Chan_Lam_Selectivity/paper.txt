ABSTRACT: Secondary N-arylsulfonamides are common in phar-
maceutical compounds owing to their valuable physicochemical
properties. Direct N-arylation of primary sulfonamides presents a
modular approach to this scaffold but remains a challenging
disconnection for transition metal-catalyzed cross coupling broadly,
including the Chan−Lam (CL) coupling of nucleophiles with
(hetero)aryl boronic acids. Although the CL coupling reaction
typically operates under mild conditions, it is also highly substrate-
dependent and prone to overarylation, limiting its generality and
predictivity. To address these gaps, we employed data science tools in
tandem with high-throughput experimentation to study and model the
CL N-arylation of primary sulfonamides. To minimize bias in training
set design, we applied unsupervised learning to systematically select a diverse set of primary sulfonamides for high-throughput data
collection and modeling, resulting in a novel data set of 3,904 reactions. This workflow enabled us to identify broadly applicable,
highly selective conditions for the CL coupling of aliphatic and (hetero)aromatic primary sulfonamides with complex organoboron
coupling partners. We also generated a regression model that successfully identifies not only high-yielding conditions for the CL
coupling of various sulfonamides but also sulfonamide features that dictate reaction outcome.

1. INTRODUCTION
N-Arylsulfonamides represent an important class of organo-
sulfur compounds, as exemplified by their presence among
various FDA-approved drugs spanning multiple disease
indications.

its polarity, geometry, hydrogen bonding properties, and

(Figure 1A).

Classically, N-arylsulfonamides
can be synthesized via addition of anilines to sulfonyl
chlorides; however, this approach is not always conducive to
synthesis of drug-like molecules due to the water sensitivity of
sulfonyl chloride reagents and attenuated nucleophilicity of
electron-poor anilines. Furthermore, the potential genotoxicity
of both anilines and sulfonyl chlorides has inspired the
development of alternate approaches.
3,4
Despite the recent
emergence of numerous catalysts and synthetic methods for
C−N coupling, transition metal-catalyzed N-arylation of
primary sulfonamides remains relatively underdeveloped. To
the best of our knowledge, fewer than 40 reports have studied
the direct N-arylation of primary sulfonamides, most of which
feature high catalyst loadings and/or high temperatures, with
relatively limited scope examples.
5−30
This may be, in part, due
to the attenuated nucleophilicity of sulfonamides, which
renders them recalcitrant in cross-coupling reactions. Selectiv-
ity poses an additional challenge for the coupling of primary
sulfonamides, given the possibility that the desired N-arylated
product can undergo further reaction to generate the undesired
N, N-diarylated product.
The CL coupling is commonly applauded for its use of
inexpensive reagents, mild reaction conditions, greater
tolerance of heterocyclic substrates than its Pd-catalyzed
counterparts, and orthogonality to traditional cross-coupling
reactions of aryl halides. Despite being a cornerstone reaction
in organic chemistry, the CL coupling notoriously lacks
predictivity and selectivity, limiting its broader applicability
for synthesis. In particular, the CL coupling of sulfonamides
remains underexplored compared to that of amines (Figure
1B). In fact, of the known examples studying CL arylation of

================================================================================

================================================================================

primary sulfonamides, the demonstrated scope remains limited
to just 19 examples across 18 literature and patent reports
(Figure 1C).
23−40
The patent literature features several
complex examples, but high or stoichiometric copper loading
is often required.
The mechanistic information gained from key experimen-
tal
41
and computational
42
studies, while insightful, has
highlighted the highly substrate-dependent nature of the
reaction: the amine substrate may bind to the catalyst at
every step of the catalytic cycle, and even participates in the
catalytic turnover step. While significant development has
allowed for extension of the CL coupling paradigm to other
C−X bond-forming reactions, even substrates within the same
class may require highly varied reaction conditions.
43
This
characteristic is particularly detrimental for discovery applica-
tions in medicinal chemistry, wherein a single set of reaction
conditions that can guarantee the generation of “enough”
product is highly desirable. It would, therefore, be of great
utility to not only identify general reaction conditions for the
selective monoarylation of primary sulfonamides, but also to
predict conditions suited to unseen substrate pairs.
Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool in
organic chemistry for optimizing synthetic processes, elucidat-
ing reaction mechanisms, and predicting reactivity.
44,45
The
ability of ML to analyze obscure patterns and generate
predictive models can prove valuable for gaining a deeper
understanding of chemical reactivity. Given this, we questioned
whether use of ML could address the lack of generality for the
CL coupling of primary sulfonamides. Current work in
reaction outcome prediction typically features mechanistically
well-defined (often catalyst/ligand-controlled) reactions, for
which it is straightforward to identify features that govern
reactivity. There are few examples applying ML toward poorly
understood reactions that may be challenging to study via
traditional organometallic and/or physical organic studies,
likely due to the large quantities of data or expensive
computations needed to elucidate reactivity patterns.
46,47
We
sought to leverage an unsupervised learning approach to select
a representative subset of substrates from a broader chemical
space,
48−51
thereby decreasing the amount of data required to
study such systems. We hypothesized that a systematic
selection strategy, coupled with high-throughput experimenta-
tion (HTE), could allow us to gain a deeper understanding of
the CL coupling.
52
Herein, we report the use of unsupervised learning to select
a set of 44 representative primary sulfonamides, which we
utilize to generate an HTE data set of 3,904 unique CL
coupling reactions. Ultimately, the HTE data enabled the
discovery of broadly applicable reaction conditions for the
monoselective N-arylation of primary sulfonamides, as well as
construction of a neural network ML model to predict optimal
conditions for both in-domain and out-of-sample substrates
(Figure 1D).
2. METHODS AND RESULTS
2.1. Systematic Dataset Design. In pursuit of general
reaction conditions, we sought to select a diverse subset of the
Janssen internal library of pharmaceutically relevant primary
sulfonamides using our previously developed workflow (Figure
2A). To investigate whether the Janssen library spanned all
relevant primary sulfonamide chemical space, we obtained a
list of 3,547 commercially available substrates from Reaxys for
comparison. To visualize the chemical space in two

coupling of sulfonamides remain limited (Reaxys, 2024). C) Only 19
sulfonamide examples have been demonstrated in the CL coupling
literature across 18 literature and patent reports, which suffer from
limited substrate complexity and high catalyst loadings, respectively.

dimensions, we undertook featurization via Mordred, an open-
source descriptor generator.
53
Reduction of the 1,182
computed features into two dimensions using Principal
Component Analysis (PCA) resulted in the chemical space
plot shown in Figure 2B. Interestingly, the sulfonamide
substrates from the library that have previously been shown
in the CL literature�two alkyl and ten simple aryl
sulfonamides�are localized in the bottom left quadrant of
the chemical space plot (Figure 2B, dark blue; see SI for
details).
54
This lack of substrate diversity may contribute to the
limited generalizability of known conditions for the CL
coupling of sulfonamides. We hypothesized that using HTE
to investigate reaction conditions across a diverse and
uniformly distributed set of sulfonamides would help us
achieve generality in the coupling of this challenging substrate
class. Superimposing the Janssen library on the Reaxys
chemical space (Figure 2B) revealed generally good coverage
of the chemical space. The right quadrant of the plot, where we
observe sparser coverage by the Janssen library, largely
contains Celecoxib derivatives, from which we planned to
select one representative example. Given that the Janssen
library would enable quick access and ensure relative substrate
diversity, we proceeded with our selection workflow.
Anticipating that DFT-based features would be most
appropriate to capture the underlying physical organic
properties relevant to reaction outcome, we computed these
features for the Janssen data set,
55
then applied Uniform
Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) dimension-
ality reduction
56
to visualize the curated, pharmaceutically
relevant chemical space (Figure 2C). Then, we applied a
hierarchical clustering algorithm to divide the chemical space
into 6 distinct clusters, selected using silhouette score. We
selected representatives approximately proportional to the size
of each cluster based on commercial availability and ease of
access (Figure 2D). Looking toward eventual validation of our
modeling efforts, we also selected 22 additional sulfonamides
to serve as out-of-sample tests (17 from the Janssen library,
and 5 from the Reaxys data set). This data-science driven
approach ultimately afforded the largest and most diverse
primary sulfonamide data set to study the CL coupling to date.
Our curated scope includes several heterocyclic sulfonamides,
as well as multisubstituted substrates for which steric and
electronic influences on reactivity may not be straightforward
to predict a priori (vide infra, Figure 5).
2.2. HTE Data Collection and Analysis. With a diverse
training set in hand, we turned our attention to HTE data set
design. Given the often-contradictory information about the
best conditions to use for the CL coupling,
57
we examined a
variety of reaction conditions (2 boronic acids, 4 copper
catalysts, 5 bases and no base, and 4 solvents), amounting to
3,072 unique experiments (Figure 3A). It is noteworthy that
authentic product synthesis, which is a prerequisite for building
quantitative UPLC/MS assays and analyzing HTE data, is a
significant but often underappreciated challenge of collecting
such a designer data set; this presents a formidable obstacle to
screening the substrate dimension, as synthesis is required for
every unique product. While we expected to observe the
desired N-arylsulfonamide as the major product under the
chosen reaction conditions, we also anticipated formation of
the undesired N,N-diaryl sulfonamide. Although the conditions
developed over the course of this work would later prove
effective for most sulfonamides in our training and validation
sets, authentic product synthesis was required at the outset,
when we had not yet identified our optimal conditions. Prior to
HTE data collection, we modified a protocol reported by
Watson and co-workers for the CL arylation of secondary
sulfonamides,
58
enabling the synthesis of both the N-aryl and
N,N-diaryl sulfonamide products from the same reaction.
While not practical for preparation of large quantities owing to
the low selectivity often observed, this protocol was quite
efficient for authentic product preparation. Low yields (<20%)
were observed in many cases, alluding to the challenge of
generality and prompting us to use amine addition into
sulfonyl chlorides to prepare 3 especially low-yielding products.

= 9%). C) Clustered Janssen chemical space with DFT features. D) Selected data set superimposed on the Janssen space.

================================================================================

================================================================================

Upon synthesis of the 64 authentic products and construction
of UPLC/MS assays, we collected our training data set in
triplicate.
Approximately 28% of the reactions delivered <10% yield of
the desired product, with the remaining 72% having yields
distributed across the full range from 10−100% (Figure 3B).
While most reactions were selective for the desired
monoarylated product, 10% of the reactions afforded >10%
yield of the undesired diarylated product. We also found that
the electronic properties of the boronic acid did not seem to
impact trends in yield (Figure 3C), DCE proved to be the
optimal solvent for the desired coupling reaction (Figure 3D),
and the base identity played a significant role in the success of
the coupling reaction (Figure 3D). Conditions with DCE and
inorganic bases (K
2
CO
3
or K
3
PO
4
) gave high yields of the
desired monoarylated product across all 22 sulfonamide
substrates. This result is consistent with the few protocols
that have been specifically optimized for the CL coupling of
sulfonamides, which tend to feature inorganic bases,
23,25,27−29
and in contrast to the majority of CL protocols, which typically
employ organic bases such as triethylamine, diisopropylethyl-
amine, and pyridine.
57
Given the large influence of the base identity on the reaction
outcome, we chose to study an additional 15 bases under the
optimal conditions identified in our initial study, constituting
an additional 480 data points. Visualizing the average yield per
base allowed us to evaluate the generality of each reaction
condition (Figure 3E). Interestingly, we identified several
bases, including CsF and KOt-Bu, that enabled successful and
general CL coupling of primary sulfonamides. Previous reports
have demonstrated that counterion identity can have a
profound effect on the oxidation potential of copper
complexes.
59,60
As such, it is possible that a judiciously chosen
inorganic base could better facilitate the necessary redox events
at the copper center.
In addition to the results of our base screen, we were
particularly interested in studying substrate-dependent reac-
tivity trends. Evaluation of the average yield per sulfonamide
allowed us to identify two trends: substrates bearing basic
heterocyclic motifs such as pyridines and pyrazoles, as well as
those bearing electron-withdrawing functional groups, per-
formed better on average than their non-heterocyclic and
electron-rich counterparts. These observations eventually
informed our featurization and modeling efforts (vide inf ra).
2.3. Synthetic Application. Our HTE campaign provided
several leads for general reaction conditions, which we next
sought to translate to preparative scale. We found that some
reoptimization was necessary to ensure mass transfer and
reproducibility, particularly due to the heterogeneity of the
reaction. While the HTE screens were run under ambient
atmosphere, bench-scale reactions were set up under O
2
atmosphere (see SI for optimization screens).
61
Further
screening revealed that while KOt-Bu and CsF both afford
high yields of the desired monoarylated product, the former
facilitates higher selectivity, particularly when coupled with
ethanol as the reaction solvent. We also found that addition of
10 equiv of H
2
O affords not only higher yields, but also better
reproducibility. The unique combination of KOt-Bu, EtOH,
and H
2
O was particularly intriguing to us. These results further
highlight the enigmatic nature of the CL coupling: although
alcohol nucleophiles are typically competent in the reaction,
62
competitive O-arylation was not observed under our reaction
conditions.
We propose several potential roles of the base, which could
account for the unique effectiveness of our optimized
conditions. First, our screening revealed that sulfonamide
reactivity is dependent on the substrate’s relative acidity and
base identity. Given the observation in our HTE that CsF and
KOt-Bu are both capable of providing generally high yields of
the desired product, we wondered whether these bases serve to

activate the boronic acid for a more facile transmetalation, in
analogy to reports with palladium.
63,64
To interrogate whether
this may be operative, we monitored the
11
B NMR shift of 4-
methoxyphenylboronic acid in the presence of various reaction
components (Figure 4A).
65
In the presence of KOt-Bu, an
upfield shift of ∼25 ppm was observed, consistent with
formation of a tetracoordinate alkoxyboronate species.
Furthermore, preforming and subjecting this species to the
reaction affords the same yield of the N-arylsulfonamide
product, supporting its intermediacy in the reaction (Figure
4B, Entry 1). By contrast, other bases either failed to induce
(Et
3
N, K
2
CO
3
) or only partially induced (CsF) an upfield shift
(see SI for details). Given that the reaction mixture contains
superstoichiometric quantities of H
2
O, EtOH, and KOt-Bu, we
were curious to investigate the active basic species. Experi-
ments varying the identity of base and solvent revealed that
ethoxide generated in situ (Figure 4B, entries 2, 4) is the active
species, rather than tert-butoxide (Figure 4B, entries 3, 5).
While exclusion of water still resulted in product formation,
slight improvements to the yield are observed on inclusion of
water (Figure 4B, parentheses).
With optimized conditions in hand, we set out to evaluate
the scope of the coupling reaction using our diverse
sulfonamide training and validation sets. Gratifyingly, our
conditions afforded good to high yields and selectivities across
nearly the entire substrate scope (Figure 5). We were
especially pleased to find that heterocyclic sulfonamides
underwent successful coupling (5, 6, 12, 18, 19, 21, 29, 30,
33, 36, 38, 44), given that such motifs can function as catalyst
poisons in other transition metal-catalyzed cross couplings. We
also found that while steric bulk can hinder reactivity in
extreme cases (23, 43), ortho-substitution was well tolerated
under the reaction conditions (13, 15−17, 22, 26, 29, 36).
Despite the broad scope of our conditions, couplings of
substrates prone to side reactions such as ester hydrolysis (18,
25, 27, 32), S
N
Ar (20), and competitive Ullmann coupling
(31, 32) were relatively low-yielding. However, we found that
simply reverting to the original conditions identified through
our HTE campaign enabled the successful coupling of these
substrates, albeit with increased formation of the undesired N,
N-diarylsulfonamide product (Figure 5, gray yields). A notable
exception was 14, which formed only trace product, likely due
to its propensity to undergo metal-mediated N−O bond
cleavage.
To better contextualize our optimized conditions relative to
prior work, we compared the yield of the CL coupling of an
alkyl (4) and aryl (12) sulfonamide across a suite of previously
published conditions (Figure 6A).
23,25,26,32−34,58
Our protocol
afforded the highest yield of desired product for both
substrates, as well as exquisite selectivity for the desired
monoarylated product. Interestingly, we found that the other
conditions were not only lower yielding and less selective, but
also highly substrate dependent, further highlighting the
challenge of generality for the CL coupling of primary
sulfonamides. The protocol developed by Watson and co-
workers
58
afforded good yield and generality for the CL
coupling of 4 and 12, albeit with competitive overarylation.
Given the success of the Watson conditions relative to other
literature conditions, we surveyed a broader scope of substrates
for comparison. In general, we found that our conditions
afforded higher (2, 4, 5, 7, 12, 19, 28, 29, 35) or comparable
(24, 26) yields of the desired product for the substrates tested
(Figure 6B). We also investigated whether introduction of an
oxygen atmosphere could improve the yield under the
conditions developed by Watson and co-workers; this generally
led to a slight increase in the yield of the desired N-
arylsulfonamide product, but at the expense of selectivity, with
a concomitant increase in formation of the N,N-diary-
lsulfonamide byproduct (see SI for details). These observa-
tions are a testament to the orthogonality of these methods:
Watson and co-workers’ protocol works well for formation of
N,N-diarylsulfonamides (symmetric and nonsymmetric alike),
whereas our protocol affords selective monoarylation in high
yields.
Pleased with the breadth of sulfonamide substrates that
underwent successful N-arylation, we sought to explore the
scope of boronic acid coupling partners with sulfonamide 29
(Figure 7A). Electron-rich (45), electron-poor (46), and
neutral (47) boronic acids all underwent coupling efficiently. A
testament to the orthogonality of the CL coupling to other
cross-coupling methodologies, chloride- (48) and bromide-
containing (49) boronic acids were well-tolerated under the
reaction conditions. Sterically hindered boronic acids also
underwent successful coupling, albeit with diminished yields
(50, 51). Arylation was successful with pyridine boronic acid
52, demonstrating the promise of these conditions for the
rapid construction of polyheterocyclic scaffolds. With an eye
toward synthetic utility, we sought to evaluate whether pinacol
Figure 4. A) An upfield shift was observed upon reaction between the boronic acid and KOt-Bu. B) Experiments varying the base and solvent
identity reveal ethoxide as the active base. Parentheses indicate yield for the reaction in the absence of water.

boronate esters were competent under our reaction conditions.
Excitingly, the coupling of phenylboronic acid pinacol ester 53
proceeded in comparable yield to the parent boronic acid.
Having demonstrated the broad utility of our optimized
conditions across a variety of sulfonamide and boronic acid
coupling partners, we sought to evaluate their application in
more complex settings. In 2016, scientists at Merck developed
a chemistry informer library of 24 medium-complexity aryl
pinacol boronates as part of a study evaluating catalytic
methods for the synthesis of pharmaceutically relevant
compounds.
66
We evaluated the CL coupling of six of these
pinacol boronates with Celecoxib to emulate a late-stage
diversification campaign (Figure 7B). While the yields for these
couplings were moderate, we were gratified to see that our
conditions, which were optimized for boronic acids, could be

successfully extended to drug-like heterocyclic pinacol
boronates (54−59) with no changes.
To further highlight the utility of our protocol in the context
of medicinal chemistry, we report the use of our CL coupling
protocol as a key step in the synthesis of antitumor agent
ODM-203.
67,68
The sulfonamide is a key structural feature of
ODM-203, and is often incorporated in tyrosine kinase
inhibitors.
69
As such, a synthetic route that enables late-stage
diversification of the sulfonamide motif is highly desirable for
medicinal chemistry campaigns. N-Arylsulfonamides are
commonly introduced via aniline addition into a sulfonyl
chloride, as in the original medicinal chemistry route toward
ODM-203.
67
However, this route necessitates reduction of a
nitro group to generate the aniline, installation of an acetyl
protecting group to render the aniline compatible with
subsequent chemistry, and deprotection to unveil the aniline
required for the sulfonamide generation. By contrast, our
proposed route utilizes robust reactions to build a convergent
route for late-stage CL coupling, installing the N-arylsulfona-
mide as the final step (Figure 8). We leveraged our optimized
conditions for the installation of cyclopropanesulfonamide in
58% yield with excellent selectivity for monoarylation as the
final step in our synthesis of ODM-203 (0.05 mmol scale).
Excitingly, the CL coupling was successfully scaled to 1 mmol
scale in 50% yield. Ultimately, we realized a 6-step longest
linear sequence synthesis in 23−27% overall yield. We also
tested other literature conditions for the CL coupling of
sulfonamides and found that only one other set of conditions
enabled successful coupling in 50% yield, though it resulted in
greater formation of the undesired overarylated product.
2.4. Predictive Modeling. Although our HTE campaign
allowed for the identification of general conditions for the N-
arylation of primary sulfonamides, the ability to make de novo
predictions of reaction performance would be valuable given
the highly substrate-dependent nature of the CL coupling.
Furthermore, while our general conditions gave good yields of
the desired products on average, we were unsurprised to find
that the optimal conditions often differed as a function of
sulfonamide identity. In fact, for 16 of the 22 sulfonamides in
our training set, the highest yielding conditions diverged from
the most general conditions. As such, we set out to predict
high-performing conditions for unseen sulfonamide substrates
in the CL coupling.
A prerequisite for any modeling effort is the selection of
relevant descriptors. To this end, modeling campaigns often

rely on hand-selection of descriptors based on a mechanistic
hypothesis or chemical intuition.
70
Given the mechanistic
ambiguity that plagues the CL coupling, we undertook a broad
featurization campaign, relying on both algorithmic feature
selection and chemical intuition to identify relevant descrip-
tors. Despite the numerous reaction components present, we
focused our efforts on generating molecular descriptors for the
sulfonamide coupling partner, as we observed a strong
influence of sulfonamide identity on reaction outcome in our
HTE studies. Using our group’s AutoQChem software,
55
we
computed global and common atomic features, including
electronegativity, atomic polar tensor (APT) charge, natural
bond orbital (NBO) charge, and buried volume (Figure 9A).
Given the observation from our HTE campaign (vide supra)
that electron-deficient sulfonamides perform better on average
than other sulfonamides, we also computed the gas phase free
energy of sulfonamide deprotonation. Our optimization
campaign also revealed the significant impact that base and
solvent identity can have on the reaction outcome, particularly
boronic acid speciation. To encode for this joint influence, we
measured the average change in NMR shift for each boronic
acid in each solvent as a function of base identity (Figure 9B);
from these experiments, we also encoded categorical
descriptors for whether remaining boronic acid was present,
and whether broadening of the boronic acid peaks was
observed. As certain sulfonamides were observed to have
reduced solubility, we also included ΔG
solvation
for each
sulfonamide in each reaction solvent, predicted by a previously
published ML model.
71
Experimentally determined categorical
features were also generated, describing whether each
sulfonamide forms a homogeneous solution in each solvent,
and whether it forms a uniform mixture (including
suspensions).
In total, 41 descriptors were generated across these methods
to evaluate for model generation. We planned to evaluate an
array of supervised ML methods�namely, multilayer percep-
tron (MLP), light gradient-boosting machine (LGBM),
random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM)
(Figure 9C) in our modeling campaign. However, we used
LGBM models for feature selection due to the speed with
which they can be trained. Ultimately, in the interest of
generating an interpretable model, Shapley additive explan-
ations
72
(SHAP) was used to select 9 descriptors that were
best correlated to reaction outcome for the training set (see SI
for details).
Several electronic properties were identified by feature
selection, prompting us to also include Hirschfeld charge at the
sulfonamide C and N, which has been shown to better
correlate to the experimental physical organic Hammett
parameter than other computed electronic features.
73
Although
the computed ΔG
deprotonation
of the sulfonamides was not
identified through feature selection, we included it in the
model given our observation that more electron-poor
sulfonamides performed better on average (vide supra). We
also opted to include one-hot-encoded features for the base,
catalyst, boronic acid, and solvent. While this limits the
model’s extrapolative ability in these dimensions, our screening
indicated that the sulfonamide identity has the greatest
influence on reaction outcome. We included sulfonamide
one-hot-encoded features, as we saw improved performance
upon their inclusion. These features complement the existing
chemically informed descriptors by offering a clearer
distinction when the model encounters substrates not present
in the training set. Specifically, for an out-of-sample substrate,
all one-hot-encoded columns related to training set substrates
would equal 0.

Given the notorious fickleness of the CL coupling, we
sought to focus on predicting reactivity trends across different
conditions, rather than precise yield values. For this reason, we
evaluated model performance with percentiles and the ranking-
based Spearman’s correlation coefficient (ρ),
74
rather than
traditional metrics like R
2
, MAE, or RMSE. For each substrate,
we took all predictions within 5% yield of the highest predicted
yield and determined the percentile rank of the corresponding
experimental yields. The average of these percentile ranks was
used to assess overall predictive performance (Figure 10A).
Henceforth, we refer to this metric as average percentile yield
ranking (APYR). A high APYR value indicates that the model
can successfully identify high-yielding conditions within the
yields attainable for a given substrate. This trend-based

approach is more practical for a chemist seeking to identify
top-yielding reaction conditions, allowing them to focus on a
few promising options instead of relying on trial and error.
We evaluated the predictions from an array of supervised
ML methods using 30 random 80:20 splits, wherein 80% of the
data is used to train a model that is then used to predict high-
yielding reaction conditions for the remaining 20% (validation
set) (see SI for model hyperparameters) (Figure 10B). The
highest-performing model (MLP) has ρ = 0.884 and APYR of
94.8 ± 6.3. This suggests that on average, the model is able to
predict reaction conditions for a given substrate that fall above
the 94.8 ± 6.3 percentile of experimental yield. To benchmark
model performance, we generated three baseline MLP models
using 1) only OHE, 2) X-randomized, and 3) y-randomized
features. As expected, the chemically informed MLP model
significantly (P < 0.001 for permutation test) outperformed the
X- and y-randomized baseline models, which had negative ρ
values and APYR of 49.0 ± 24.7 and 60.9 ± 20.3, respectively.
Although the informed MLP model did not show significant
improvement over the OHE baseline model (ρ = 0.882 and
APYR = 94.2 ± 7.9), we believe this may be a demonstration
of the ability of the complex neural network framework to learn
underlying reactivity patterns in the OHE data set.
While random splits are often used to evaluate model
performance, they provide an optimistic estimate of a model’s
ability to extrapolate to unseen substrates. To simulate an out-
of-sample test case more closely, we estimated generalization
error with leave-one-group-out (LOGO) cross-validation,
wherein one sulfonamide substrate is withheld from model
training entirely, and all the data for that substrate is used
instead as the validation set. This process is repeated for each
sulfonamide, and the final metrics are averaged across all
substrates. This evaluation tends to result in larger error but is
more representative of a real-life scenario. When faced with
this more challenging assessment, the MLP model performed
well, with ρ = 0.735 and APYR of 85.1 ± 14.5 (vs ρ = 0.717
and APYR of 83.4 ± 16.6 for the OHE baseline model). The
lower value for Spearman’s coefficient shows that for out-of-
sample predictions, it is more difficult for the model to
accurately rank reaction conditions from best to worst. Closer
analysis reveals that only four substrates (1, 24, 25, and 29)
had APYR values below the 75th percentile; the remaining 18
substrates from the training set scored 90.7 ± 8.7 on average
(Figure 10C). The APYR values suggest that the model would
still be highly effective for predicting promising reaction
conditions for unseen sulfonamides.
The LOGO assessment provided the opportunity to gain
further insight into the predictive capabilities and limitations of
the model. We analyzed the experimental vs predicted yields
for each individual substrate, using the R
2
for the line of best fit
to evaluate how effectively our model captures underlying
reactivity trends and identifies high-yielding conditions. All the
substrates had lines of best fit with R
2
> 0.4 with the exceptions
of 1, 24, 26, and 29 (Figure 10C, red points). Computational
studies revealed that 1 and 29 can access bidentate coordinate
modes with a copper catalyst (computed with Cu(OAc)
2
);
although other substrates such as 6 were also favored to access
bidentate complexes, it is possible that the solution-phase
behavior of 1 and 29 differ sufficiently to alter observed
reactivity; inclusion of additional substrates for which similar
binding modes are accessible may improve model performance
in these cases. 24 and 26 are highly electron-poor examples
that may not be adequately represented in the data set.
Finally, we tested our model’s ability to predict high-yielding
reaction conditions for CL coupling of previously selected
unseen test substrates (8−11, 14−17, 21−23, 30, 32, 36−44)
(vide supra, Figure 5). The model was able to capture reactivity
trends and predict high-yielding conditions for the external
validation data set, with ρ = 0.468 and APYR = 75.2 ± 15.8 (vs
ρ = 0.474 and APYR = 77.3 ± 20.0 for the OHE baseline
model) (Figure 10D). Importantly, these statistics are
significantly more predictive (P < 0.005) than the X- and y-
scrambled baseline models, suggesting that the chemically
informed model is better than random. The model predicts
high-yielding conditions with APYR > 70th percentile for 12 of
the 22 external validation substrates, and ≥50th percentile for
all 22. Interestingly, the substrates with APYR values below 60
tended to be coordinating and/or highly electron-deficient, in
line with our LOGO analysis.
While the Spearman’s correlation coefficient is lower for the
external validation data set, this is expected given that external
data often presents new challenges that may not be fully
represented in the training set. These results suggest that some
substrate-dependent effects, especially pertaining to sulfona-
mide electronics and interactions with catalyst, may be
inadequately represented in the training set, and/or that the
features used do not fully capture the relevant information.
The challenges of modeling notwithstanding, our results
indicate that our model successfully captures the underlying
trends in reactivity for this notoriously difficult-to-predict
reaction. Though the chemically informed model offers
marginal improvements to overall performance over the
OHE baseline model, it is better able to capture substrate-
level reactivity trends. The excellent APYR values indicate that
a chemist could use our model to identify high-yielding
reaction conditions with confidence, particularly for an unseen
substrate (Figure 10E). For example, for validation substrates
32 and 23, our optimized conditions gave 0 and 18% yield,
respectively. We queried the model for high-yielding
conditions for these substrates, and it delivered successful
conditions that afforded above 60% yield (Figure 10F). The
model was also able to predict high-yielding conditions for
substrates that worked well under our optimized conditions,
such as 37.
Although the model may not perfectly predict precise yields,
its ability to rank reaction conditions by relative performance
provides significant value in narrowing down the conditions
most likely to succeed. This is particularly advantageous in
medicinal chemistry, where rapid diversification is required, as
well as in scenarios where material is precious or experiments
are resource-intensive. Our model may serve as a decision-
making tool for selecting promising reaction conditions
without exhaustive and expensive trial and error.
3. CONCLUSIONS
In conclusion, we applied an unsupervised learning workflow
to select a diverse training set, collected an HTE data set of
3,904 unique experiments, and constructed a predictive ML
model. The diversity in our training set led to the identification
of general conditions for the selective monoarylation of
primary sulfonamides; we established the broadest scope of
primary sulfonamides to date, filling a previously outstanding
gap in the CL methodology. Careful feature engineering
enabled the generation of an ML model that successfully
predicts high-yielding conditions for the CL coupling of
unseen sulfonamide substrates, ultimately saving valuable time

and resources for such a substrate-dependent reaction. Analysis
of our data set and the resulting models revealed several
opportunities for future improvement, including the study of
substrates that can ligate copper, as well as substrates of
varying nucleophile acidity. Importantly, this work outlines a
workflow for employing various data science tools to study
challenging reactions. It is our hope that this study not only
provides practicing organic chemists with general and selective
reaction conditions and a useful ML model, but also inspires
similar investigations of other reactions for which a panacea
has yet to be discovered.
