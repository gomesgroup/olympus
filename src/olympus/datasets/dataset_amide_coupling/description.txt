Amide Coupling Reactions with 2-amino-1H-imidazole-5-carboxylic acid

Reaction Setup:

This dataset encompasses amide coupling reactions between 2-amino-1H-imidazole-5-carboxylic acid 
(SMILES: NC1=NC=C(C(O)=O)N1) and four selected amine nucleophiles:

1. 4-heptylaniline (SMILES: CCCCCCCC1=CC=C(C=C1)N)
2. 1,3-diaminopropane (SMILES: NCCCN) 
3. octan-1-amine (SMILES: CCCCCCCCN)
4. 2-fluoroaniline (SMILES: NC1=CC=CC=C1F)

The experimental design explores a comprehensive parameter space including:
- 5 coupling reagents (EDC, HATU, HBTU, PyBOP, DCC)
- 5 base options (DIPEA, NMM, TEA, DMAP, NO_BASE)
- 3 additive options (HOBt, OxymaPure, NO_ADDITIVE)
- 4 solvents (DMF, acetonitrile, DMSO, THF)
- 2 temperatures (25°C, 40°C)
- Variable stoichiometry for all reagents

Experimental Procedure:

Reactions are prepared manually using 2 mL volumetric flasks with 1 mg precision weighing. 
The carboxylic acid concentration is held constant at 0.1 M (25.42 mg, 0.0002 mol) across 
all experiments, with other reagents added in stoichiometric excess as specified by the 
equivalents parameters.

CRITICAL: Different coupling reagents require different addition orders due to distinct 
reaction mechanisms:

For EDC/DCC (Carbodiimide Reagents):
1. Dissolve carboxylic acid (25.42 mg) in solvent (2 mL)
2. Add additive (HOBt/OxymaPure) and coupling reagent simultaneously
3. Pre-activate for 10-15 minutes at specified temperature
4. Add amine and base together
5. React for 2-24 hours depending on conditions

For HATU/HBTU/PyBOP (Uronium/Phosphonium Reagents):
1. Dissolve carboxylic acid (25.42 mg) in solvent (2 mL)
2. Add additive (if specified - optional for these reagents)
3. Add coupling reagent and base simultaneously for activation
4. Brief pre-activation for 2-5 minutes
5. Add amine
6. React for 30 minutes - 4 hours

The different addition orders are critical for optimal results as carbodiimides require 
pre-activation with additives, while uronium/phosphonium reagents require base for 
activation and have built-in additive functionality.

Analysis Method:

Reaction mixtures are analyzed by LCMS using caffeine (5.0 mM, 1.942 mg per reaction) as 
an internal standard. Relative yield is calculated from the peak area ratio of product to 
internal standard, normalized against control reactions.

Safety Considerations:

CRITICAL SAFETY WARNINGS:
- HOBt is EXPLOSIVE (UN3474 Class 4.1) - use OxymaPure when possible
- DCC is a potent allergen - mandatory glove use and fume hood operation
- DMF has toxicity concerns - ensure adequate ventilation
- All reactions must be conducted in fume hoods with appropriate PPE

Procedural Documentation:

Three detailed experimental procedures are provided:
1. EDC/DCC coupling procedure (carbodiimide-specific protocols)
2. HATU/HBTU/PyBOP coupling procedure (uronium/phosphonium-specific protocols)
3. Generic procedure (general guidance - refer to specific procedures for optimal results)
