Reductive amination of staurosporine.

Reaction Setup:

SPT Labtech Mosquito®HTS liquid handling robot was used to generate a reaction plate containing all possible reaction
conditions per aldehyde building block. 2 solvents x 2 concentrations x 3 AcOH loadings x 4 TTIP loadings = 48 reaction
conditions per aldehyde building block. 
48 reaction conditions x 16 building blocks = 768 reactions. 

The reactions were mixed (core, aldehyde/ketone, acetic acid, titanium tetraisopropoxide) 
and allowed to sit for 4 hours before addition of STAB to the reaction mixtures. 
After 18 hours, reactions were quenched and examined. 3x1 µL 0.5 M AcOH in DMSO
(containing PhPh internal standard) quench solution was added to each reaction well. 
1 µL of each quenched reaction (4 µL total volume) was transferred from the 1,536 plate 
reaction well to a 384-well analytical plate containing 60 µL DMSO per well. 
Results of this screen are presented in Figure 3 as a heat map arrayed by reaction conditions after quenching.
Reactions are represented by relative percent conversion, calculated from UV peak area of product and staurosporine core.
